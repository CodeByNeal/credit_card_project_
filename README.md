# credit_card_project_
#A fraud detection system was built to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. The project involved preprocessing transactional data, handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and training models like Random Forest and XGBoost. Special focus was given to minimizing false positives while maximizing fraud detection accuracy.
Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn  
Goal: Detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and low false positive rate.  
Key Skills: Anomaly Detection, Imbalanced Data Handling, Model Tuning
